 * be able to access this from the app.
 * For more information regarding FTC's annotations, go to this
 * link...

 * TeleOp ANNOTATION JAVADOC
 * </a>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This demonstrates how simple a Tank Drive system
 * is to create with this library. While, sadly, there's not
 * absolutely no code, there's very little, which (should)
 * make this simplify the process of OpMode creation quite a bit.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Because you're still interacting with lower-level Java, rather
 * than an even further abstracted scripting language, you still
 * have full access to all the FTC technologies you know and love.
 * With that being said, you can still utilize this library's
 * utils & functions to simplify the process of creating an
 * OpMode and better organize all of your team's code.
