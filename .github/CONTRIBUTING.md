# Contributing to this library
I'm entirely open to suggestions and help with writing 
this library. I'm not the most experienced programmer in
the entire world, and really, all I'm trying to do
is create an expansive and easy to use library to aid
in FTC teams developing the most technologically complex
and most useful and purposeful robot. If you'd like to
contribute, please feel free to make a pull request,
or whatever else you'd like to do.

## Bug reports
If you notice any bugs, please write a detailed report
in the 'Issues' tab on the GitHub page. It would
be greatly appreciated if you could do so, it's hugely
helpful so that I don't have to test every single line
of code. I'll try to get around to fixing any bugs you
may have found.
